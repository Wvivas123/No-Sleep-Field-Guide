The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of
computer files between a client and server on a computer network. It is a plain-text protocol
that uses as new line character 0x0d 0x0a so sometimes you need to connect using telnet or nc -C.
Default Port: 21
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21     open  ftp
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unauthed enumeration:
With nmap:
sudo nmap -sV -p21 -sC -A [ip address]

Try Anonymous Login:
ftp [ip address]

Try to get a file:
GET [file name]

Try to push a file
PUT [file name]

Browser connection
You can connect to a FTP server using a browser (like Firefox) using a URL like:
ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.10.10.98
Note that if a web application is sending data controlled by a user directly to a FTP server
you can send double URL encode %0d%0a (in double URL encode this is %250d%250a) bytes and make
the FTP server perform arbitrary actions. One of this possible arbitrary actions is to download
content from a users controlled server, perform port scanning or try to talk to other plain-text
based services (like http).

Some FTP commands
USER username
PASS password
HELP The server indicates which commands are supported

PORT 127,0,0,1,0,80This will indicate the FTP server to establish a connection with the
IP 127.0.0.1 in port 80 (you need to put the 5th char as "0" and the 6th as the port in
decimal or use the 5th and 6th to express the port in hex).

EPRT |2|127.0.0.1|80|This will indicate the FTP server to establish a TCP connection
(indicated by "2") with the IP 127.0.0.1 in port 80. This command supports IPv6.

LIST This will send the list of files in current folder
LIST -R List recursively (if allowed by the server)

APPE /path/something.txt This will indicate the FTP to store the data received from a passive
connection or from a PORT/EPRT connection to a file. If the filename exists, it will append the data.

STOR /path/something.txt Like APPE but it will overwrite the files
STOU /path/something.txt Like APPE, but if exists it won't do anything.
RETR /path/to/file A passive or a port connection must be establish. Then,
the FTP server will send the indicated file through that connection
REST 6 This will indicate the server that next time it send something using RETR it
should start in the 6th byte.
TYPE i Set transfer to binary
PASV This will open a passive connection and will indicate the user were he can connects
PUT /tmp/file.txt Upload indicated file to the FTP
