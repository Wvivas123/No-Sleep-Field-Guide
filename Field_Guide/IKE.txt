IPsec is the most commonly used technology for both gateway-to-gateway (LAN-to-LAN) and host to
gateway (remote access) enterprise VPN solutions.

IKE is a type of ISAKMP (Internet Security Association Key Management Protocol) implementation,
which is a framework for authentication and key exchange. IKE establishes the security association (SA)
between two endpoints through a three-phase process:

-Phase 1: Establish a secure channel between 2 endpoints using a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) or certificates.
It can use main mode (3 pairs of messages) or aggresive mode.

-Phase1.5: This is optional, is called Extended Authentication Phase and authenticates the user
that is trying to connect (user+password).

-Phase2: Negotiates the parameter for the data security using ESP and AH. It can use a different
algorithm than the one used in phase 1 (Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)).

#Finding a valid transformation
ike-scan -M 172.16.21.200

Output should look like this:

Starting ike-scan 1.9 with 1 hosts (http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools/ike-scan/)
172.16.21.200    Main Mode Handshake returned
    HDR=(CKY-R=d90bf054d6b76401)
    SA=(Enc=3DES Hash=SHA1 Group=2:modp1024 Auth=PSK LifeType=Seconds LifeDuration=28800)
    VID=4048b7d56ebce88525e7de7f00d6c2d3c0000000 (IKE Fragmentation)

Ending ike-scan 1.9: 1 hosts scanned in 0.015 seconds (65.58 hosts/sec). 1 returned handshake; 0 returned notify

As you can see in the previous response, there is a field called AUTH with the value PSK.
This means that the vpn is configured using a preshared key (and this is really good for a pentester).
The value of the last line is also very important:

-0 returned handshake; 0 returned notify: This means the target is not an IPsec gateway.
-1 returned handshake; 0 returned notify: This means the target is configured for IPsec and
 is willing to perform IKE negotiation, and either one or more of the transforms you proposed
 are acceptable (a valid transform will be shown in the output).
-0 returned handshake; 1 returned notify: VPN gateways respond with a notify message when none
of the transforms are acceptable (though some gateways do not, in which case further analysis
and a revised proposal should be tried).
